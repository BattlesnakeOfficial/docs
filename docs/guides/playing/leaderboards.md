# Leaderboards

**Battlesnake Leaderboards are fully automated competitive ladders you can enter your Battlesnakes in to compete against other developers!**

## How do Leaderboards work?
Leaderboards run a fixed number of games between a set time frame daily. Winning matches increases your Rating in the Leaderboard, just as losing matches decreases it. Developers are then ranked by their Rating. 

Ratings are updated daily. Players are then ranked according to their Rating, which then determines their standing on the Leaderboard compared to other developers.

At the end of each month, developers are awarded Battlesnake Points based on rank. But Ratings will **NOT** reset. 

**Rating**: The value your Battlesnake earns by winning Leaderboard games.

**Ranking**: Refers to your standing in the Leaderboard compared to other developers, sorted by rating.

## How do Ratings work?

Leaderboards use an unmodified [TrueSkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill) algorithm to track and update player ratings. With the Trueskill system, there's no disadvantage to joining a Leaderboard already in progress, so drop in your Battlesnake anytime!
