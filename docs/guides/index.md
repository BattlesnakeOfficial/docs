# What is Battlesnake?

**Battlesnake is an autonomous survival game played by web developers around the world.**

Each Battlesnake is controlled by a live web server and the code _you_ write. It moves around the game board according to your algorithm, attempting to find food, avoid other Battlesnakes, and stay alive as long as possible.


**Developers of all skill levels** use Battlesnake to learn new technologies, improve their programming skills, and have fun with friends, family, and colleagues. Anyone can play for free and join competitive [Leaderboards](guides/playing/leaderboards). Success at the highest level requires creativity, unique strategies, and excellent programming.

## What can I do with my Battlesnake?

**Custom Games:** Create unique scenarios to test different algorithms against friends, community members, and pre-made Battlesnake bots.

**Leaderboards:** A set of competitive leaderboards for testing your skills against other developers. Throw your Battlesnakes into ladders, each with unique modes. Matches run between a set time each day, allowing you to make tweaks to your code between matches. [See guide.](guides/playing/leaderboards.md)
