# Map: Constrictor

In this map, Battlesnakes grow by 1 length every turn regardless of food consumption, and health points never decrease. No food is spawned on the board during a constrictor game.

This creates a challenging, fast-paced game mode, and unique challenges around path-finding and board control.
