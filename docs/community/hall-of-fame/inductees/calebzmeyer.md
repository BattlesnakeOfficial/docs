When it comes to Battlesnake, grabbing that last piece of food can grant you a competitive advantage. But to make it to the top, you’ll have to start thinking about more than your stomach! Enter <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/calebzmeyer"> calebzmeyer</a> and “Undefined Behaviour”, who in 2019 implemented this never before seen strategy to dominate what would become the last in-person Battlesnake tournament for years to come. Capturing the caster's attention, fellow competitors' adoration, and ultimately a championship title, their immortalization in the Hall of Fame highlights the value of thinking outside the box and trying something completely unexpected!
