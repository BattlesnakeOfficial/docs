# Code of Conduct

**Effective Date: November 30, 2023**

Battlesnake was created as a way to have fun programming with friends, learn new skills and technologies, and build the communities around us. We believe in building safe spaces for programmers to explore, develop, and master their skillsets.

We strive to build communities and experiences that are:

#### Accessible

Battlesnake is for everyone. Whether you are new to programming or have been a professional developer for 30+ years, you can find a place at Battlesnake to learn, grow and be successful. Everyone should have the tools, support, and access to play.

#### Inclusive

Battlesnake is an inclusive community. This means we are welcoming and respectful of all Battlesnake community members. As our community grows and more people join with different backgrounds and skills, we will see a stronger and more vibrant community.

#### Collaborative

Battlesnake is a place for collaboration. Developers from around the world are here to learn, grow, and connect with other developers with widely varied backgrounds and experiences.

_By adopting this Code of Conduct, Battlesnake community members commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of Battlesnake and its communities. Any persons who do not follow this Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the Battlesnake platform._


### Our Pledge
