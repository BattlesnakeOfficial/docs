## Our Mission

Our mission is to help every developer, become a better developer. We build games for programmers that encourage self-directed learning, are challenging to master, and are fun to share with friends and family.


## Our Values

#### Learn by building the real thing.

The best way for developers to learn is to build, and we focus on helping developers explore and build experience with tools and technologies used in their professional careers.

#### Celebrate success at all levels.

Success means different things to different people, and we believe all successes should be celebrated equally. Someone's very first Battlesnake is just as impressive as another's competitive accolades.

#### Encourage collaboration over competition.

Even though Battlesnake is a competitive game, success in our mission involves developers helping each other learn, working together on new and exciting ideas, and celebrating with one another along the way.

#### Embrace open-source software.

We believe in the power of open-source collaboration. We strive to code in public, give back to those that build for others, and encourage all developers to do the same.

#### Build powerful communities.

We work hard to encourage and support communities of all shapes and sizes. Anyone who wants to participate, organize, or volunteer in our community should feel welcome and supported, and anyone with ideas should feel heard and appreciated.

#### Include everyone.

Our games should be fun, accessible, and exciting for everyone involved. Even if you don't know how to program, everyone should feel welcome and still have a great time.
