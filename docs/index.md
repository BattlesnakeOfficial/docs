# What is Battlesnake?

**Battlesnake is a competitive programming game where your code is the controller.**

In this game, each Battlesnake is controlled in real-time by a live web server, responding to the [Battlesnake API](api). It navigates the game board based on your algorithm, trying to find food, avoid other Battlesnakes, and survive as long as possible. Battlesnakes can be built using any tech stack you'd like, and we encourage you to step outside of your comfort zone.

**Developers of all skill levels** use Battlesnake to explore new technologies, improve their programming skills, and engage in friendly competition with friends, family, and colleagues. It's free to play, and you can participate in competitive Leaderboards, Tournaments, and Competitions. Success at the highest level requires creativity, thoughtful strategy, and solid programming.
