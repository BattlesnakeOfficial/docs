# Overview

**Developers of all skill levels** use Battlesnake to learn new technologies, improve their programming skills, and have fun with friends, family, and colleagues.

**Battlesnake is an autonomous survival game.** Each Battlesnake is controlled by a live web server and the code _you_ write. It moves independently attempting to find food, avoid other Battlesnakes, and stay alive as long as possible.

Anyone can play Battlesnake, either by training with the solo [Challenges](../guide/quick-start-challenges-guide.md), [Battlegrounds](../guide/battlegrounds-guide.md), or by competing in online [League Tournaments](../guide/quick-start-league-guide.md). Success at the highest level requires creativity, unique strategies, and excellent programming.

Our mission is **to make it fun and accessible for anyone to become a better programmer**.

## What can I do with my Battlesnake?

**Solo Challenges**: Challenges are the ‚Äúsingle-player campaign‚Äù of Battlesnake. It‚Äôs just you and a problem that needs solving. They're a great way to test and build up your skills. [See guide.](../guide/quick-start-challenges-guide.md)

**The Battlegrounds:** A monthly cycling competition for testing your skills against other developers. Throw your Battlesnakes into ladders, each with unique modes. Matches run between a set time each day, allowing you to make tweaks to your code between matches. [See guide.](../guide/battlegrounds-guide.md)

**Compete in Leagues:** Leagues are limited-time competitions where the best of the best compete for title, prizes, and prestige! They‚Äôre only held 4 times a year and the finals are streamed live on Twitch. Has your Battlesnake got what it takes? [See guide.](../guide/quick-start-league-guide.md)
