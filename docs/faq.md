# Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know how to program to play Battlesnake?

Battlesnake is best for those with beginner-level programming skills and above. To build your own Battlesnake, you'll need to know the basics of responding to web requests in at least one programming language.

If you're brand new to programming and want to start learning - awesome, we're happy you're here and welcome you to give Battlesnake a try! However, if you get frustrated quickly you might want to start with some online programming courses and tutorials to get the basics down.

### Is Battlesnake only for machine learning and AI developers?

Certainly not, you can use any technology, tools, and algorithms you want. It doesn't have to be built with machine learning or artificial intelligence - in fact, many developers have created incredibly competitive Battlesnakes using simple programs and decision trees that employ specific and creative strategies.

We suggest you start with the technologies you're comfortable with and expand to include new things you want to learn.

### Which cloud provider and region should I use?

You can build a successful Battlesnake on almost any cloud provider, hosted anywhere in the world. Your choice of cloud provider has no impact on your ability to play the game and we encourage you to explore and learn new platforms.

If you are wanting to compete at the highest level and are worried about optimizing available compute time and round-trip latency, you may want to host your Battlesnake inside one of the supported [game engine regions](tips/engine-regions).

### How does the game engine work?

The Battlesnake rules implementation and core engine is [open source](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules), and we encourage you to explore turn resolution and game mechanics to learn all the details.

### How do I organize a Battlesnake competition for my class, workplace, or friend group?

There are a few ways we can help folks wanting to run their own competition. If you're interested in doing so, reach out to any of the core team members on Discord.
