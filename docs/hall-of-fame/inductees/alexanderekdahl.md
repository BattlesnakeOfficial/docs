Relatively unknown when they first entered the fray in 2020, <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/u/alexanderekdahl"> alexanderekdahl</a> and their unforgettable Battlesnake “Pretzel” dominated the competitive season in 2021. Holding onto the top spot on both 2021 Spring League leaderboards, <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/u/alexanderekdahl"> alexanderekdahl</a> finished that season as runner-up in two of the tournaments, including the Competitive Elite and the Royal Platinum divisions. Their journey into the Battlesnake Hall of Fame was not cemented, however, until a triumphant return and rapid climb of the 2021 Summer League leaderboard, when they finally captured the elusive title of Champion of the Elite division.
