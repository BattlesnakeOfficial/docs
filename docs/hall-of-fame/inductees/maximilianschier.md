Entering the Hall of Fame takes drive, determination and (for some) a lengthy plane ride! This was certainly the case in 2019 for <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/u/maximilianschier"> maximilianschier</a> and their snake ‚ÄúNieders√§chsische Kreuzotter‚Äù (also known as "Neidersnake") who made their mark as one of the first international developers to compete in the finals of an in-person tournament. While this was an impressive start to their hall of fame journey, it was only a small part of what led to their membership in this inaugural cohort, with <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/u/maximilianschier"> maximilianschier</a> going on to claim multiple championship titles, including in the 2019 Winter Classic Veteran Tournament.
