Long before the word Battlesnake became part of internet lore, there were developers who knew it would need gladiators—​​nay heroes—to inspire the next generation. There are, perhaps, none more famous than OG Snake Developer <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/robbles"> robbles</a> and “Chicken Snake”. More than code, more than snake, more than strategy (more than chicken), "Chicken Snake" never claimed a championship title, but through their cowardice and ability to avoid everything at all costs (even at its own life) won <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/robbles"> robbles</a> a place in our hearts and Battlesnake history forever.
