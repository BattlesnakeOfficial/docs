While 2020 was known around the globe for... a lot of things, 2020 was also the year of the meteoric rise (and surprise retirement) of the developer formerly known as <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/u/tofu"> tofu</a>. With a cadre of soy inspired Battlesnakes, most notably the self-named “tofu” snake, this next-level competitor showcased the true power of Monte-Carlo tree search, easily dominating the Fall League competition and taking home the first ever Winter Classic Elite Tournament crown. While they may have left the world of Battlesnake behind, they will always be remembered as a powerhouse competitor and they have certainly proved <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/u/tofu"> tofu</a> isn’t just for cooking anymore!
