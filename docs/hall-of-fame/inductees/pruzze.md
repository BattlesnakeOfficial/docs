If you’ve been around the Battlesnake Community for any period of time, there is no doubt you’ve heard whispers of a developer called <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/pruzze"> pruzze</a>. Back in 2019; however, this legend was all but unknown, until their eponymous Battlesnake thrust them into the community spotlight as one destined for greatness. Currently holding 100 achievements and counting, the most in Battlesnake History, we can’t forget the impressive wins that put them on this path to immortality: Elite Division Champion during the 2020 Summer League and the 2021 Spring League Royale Platinum Division Champion.‍
