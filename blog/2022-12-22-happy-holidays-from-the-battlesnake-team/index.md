Hello Battlesnake Developers,

With the end of the year fast approaching, we wanted to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for being a part of our community this year.

Here are a few highlights made possible thanks to your support in 2022:

- **10,000,000+ Games Played**
- **12,000+ Livestream Views**
- **1,000+ Discord Members**

And, of course, we were thrilled this past weekend to induct the first seven legendary Battlesnake Developers into the [Hall of Fame](https://ml.battlesnake.com/te/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjQwODc2LFwibFwiOjc1MjI5MTY1Nzc5OTQ0NjA2LFwiclwiOjc1MjI5MTc0MDcyMDgzNDg3fSIsInMiOiJlODgxNzgxMzlmNDYzOWQ1In0).

We are so grateful to have such a dedicated global community of developers who play Battlesnake, and we hope that you all have a safe and happy holiday season.

See you in 2023!
Andrew, Taraneh, Darcy, Sherri, Rob, Aurora, Chris, and Brad
