## Tournament Format

### Spring League Platinum Tournament (March 19th)

Part one of the 2022 Spring League tournament will take place on **Saturday**, **March 19th at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5PM CET** on the [Battlesnake Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/battlesnakeofficial) with the 32 Platinum Qualified Battlesnakes.

In this phase, to advance in the first round, a Battlesnake must get 2 wins instead of 1. Once they earn 2 wins and advance, additional games are played (without them) until a second snake accrues 2 wins and also advances. 

Each group in the initial stage will play 4-6 games to determine the two winners that move onto the next stage of the tournament.

In the next two stages of competition (i.e the Quarterfinals and Semifinals), 2 wins are again required in each round to advance to the finals. Once there, the remaining 4 snakes face their final battle (a race to 3 wins). And the victor will crowned the Platinum Spring League Champion.

### Spring League Elite Tournament (March 26th)

In the second day of competition, streaming live on **Saturday, March 26th at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5PM CET**, we are back again with 2 wins required in each round leading up to the finals, but this time with the qualified Battlesnakes competing for the title of 2022 Spring League *Elite *Champion.
