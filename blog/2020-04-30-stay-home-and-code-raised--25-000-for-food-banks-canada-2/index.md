Throughout April we’ve been running an online programming league called [Stay Home and Code](https://medium.com/battlesnake/battlesnake-stay-home-and-code-123746cc04ea),raising money for Food Banks Canada.
![](./img/1-lZp6WvEzPnFrFcXMwtsubw.png)Stay Home and Code was presented by RBC and AWS, in partnership with Communitech and Prospect.
Over 300 developers from all over Canada (and around the world!) stayed home to build, tweak, and fine-tune their Battlesnakes in preparation for a [live Battlesnake tournament](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/602731416?t=00h12m25s) held on April 25th. The event has been a lot of fun, and we were humbled by how our community rallied to support a great cause. Together we raised $25,000.

Our goal was simple: engage our community and rally to support organizations operating on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re proud and thankful to have such an opportunity.

Thank you, and stay safe!
