## Peoples Choice Contenders

While Battlesnake is about code, it is also about community, and that is one of the reasons why the Peoples Choice award was created back in 2020.

:::info

Decided by Cheers on the League Leaderboard, People Choice winners may not walk away with a cash prize, but they do walk away with the ability to create their own bespoke Battlesnake customization.
