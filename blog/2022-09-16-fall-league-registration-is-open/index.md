## **Fall League Game Modes**

### Something Old and Something New

While we are introducing some fun new features this fall, a couple things will mirror Summer League. Deadly walls, wrapped mode, and the $1000 prize pool will remain unchanged.

### Deadly Hazard Walls

Once again, one wrong move could spell **game over** for your Battlesnake. Collisions with a hazard wall are fatal—dealing 100 damage to your Battlesnake.

### Wrapped Mode

Battlesnakes can pass through the outer boundaries of the board by using gaps in the hazard walls to appear on the opposite side. Should another Battlesnake be on the other side of the board at the same time, [standard collision rules apply](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/game/rules#collisions).

### Prize Pool

We're giving away a [prize pool of over $1000](https://store.battlesnake.com/collections/prize-packs) worth of Battlensnake goodies including gift cards, trophies, medals and of course eternal bragging rights. 

### Game Board - All New Islands & Bridges Hazard Map

This new maps features four quadrants separated by deadly hazard rivers that are not only impassible by Battlesnakes, but a one-hit kill! Games on this map will be played on an **11x11 game board**.
