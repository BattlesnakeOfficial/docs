## The 2020 Winter Classic Tournament

Last year we held the first ever Battlesnake Winter Classic and this year we’re back with the second annual snow-filled showdown. Will [Ravioli](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/joprogrammer/ravioli/) and [Niedersächsische Kreuzotter (a.k.a. Niedersnake)](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/maximilianschier/niedersachsische-kreuzotter/) defend their titles?

This year’s [Winter Classic Tournament](http://play.battlesnake.com/winter-classic) will be broadcast live on December 19th, and will feature tournaments across three divisions: Rookie, Veteran, and the new Elite Division for top-tier Battlesnakes.

**New this year!** Participants must pre-qualify for the tournament by competing in the Qualifier Arenas between now and Dec 18th. Every two weeks, the top Battlesnakes in each division will qualify for the tournament, meaning that everyone has up to four chances to qualify.

Qualifying developers will be announced [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/BattlesnakeOfficial) during our biweekly Snake Pit Live broadcast, so tune in for updates!
