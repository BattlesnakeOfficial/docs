Featured as part of the [CascadiaJS 2021 Pre-Conference](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/hackday) festivities on November 1st, the [Cascadia Cup](https://play.battlesnake.com/competitions/cascadiajs-cup-2021) is an opportunity for Battlesnake Developers new and old to have some fun while competing for fame and glory in the Battlesnake arena.

Virtual doors for the[ Battlesnake Hack Day](https://2021.cascadiajs.com/hackday) open at 9:30am PDT, after which new developers will have the chance to learn how to code their Battlesnake (in any language they choose) at the morning workshop which begins at 10:00am PDT. 

Then at 7:00pm PDT, after a day of Hacking, competitors and fans alike can join us over on [Battlesnake.TV](https://battlesnake.tv) as we pit these robo-snakes against each other in an amazing tournament that will be live streamed on Twitch!

Although participants should have a base-level of comfort writing code in at least one programming language, no experience is necessary! Starter project templates, free hosting options, and a tutorial session are all provided.

### Amazing Rewards just for Participating!

While only four snakes will be eligible for prizes after they face-off against each other in the finals, all participants who enter a snake will have the chance to earn a complimentary ticket to the conference, and the Cascadia Cup Champion will walk away with not only bragging rights, but a Gift card to the [Battlesnake Merch Store](https://store.battlesnake.com/)!
