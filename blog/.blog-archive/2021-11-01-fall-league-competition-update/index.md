### Ladder and Tournament Tweaks

We have been closely watching the Fall League leaderboard and we're going to make some small changes to the tournament structure and point thresholds.

The updated scoring system we introduced for Fall League has worked out relatively well. Â Unfortunately, the goal posts we defined for the tiers turned out to be far too aggressive and combined with the more open matching system we implemented, lead to the exclusion of many Battlesnakes from the competition. 

To resolve this issue, we are updating the points required for each tier to better represent how we see the ladder developing. In addition, we are going to reduce the size of the Platinum tournament to 16 Battlesnakes, just like the Elite Tournament.

We hope these changes will make Fall League feel more satisfying for everyone involved, providing exciting tournaments for the Elite, Platinum and Gold divisions.
