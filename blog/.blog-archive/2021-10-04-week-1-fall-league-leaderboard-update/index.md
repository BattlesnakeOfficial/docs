With one full-week of Fall League competition now complete, including the first episode of [Snake Pit Live!](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1165510319) and the return of the Casters Crown , we thought it was the perfect time to check out the [leaderboard](https://play.battlesnake.com/arena/fall-league-2021/) and see which Battlesnakes have risen to the top and which are competitors to watch as the Fall League competition heats up over the next six weeks! üî•üçÇüî•

## Top Tier Bhumbas

If there is one thing that can be certain about the 2021 Fall League by looking at this weeks leaderboard standings, it is that there is some epic competition in store as some of the most impressive Battlesnakes of all time vie for the final Elite Championship title of 2021 competitive season.

Already we have seen veteran competitors like **kudu**, **pruzze**, **Hegberg** and **Nettogrof** make quick work of their competitors to claim 4 of the 5 top spots, with 4th place team **MetadataSnakes **returning to the competition with a vengeance after being knocked out of the Summer League Elite tournament during the semi-finals.

Even with many of the remaining Top 10 positions currently filled-out by relative newcomers **jlafayette**, **alxv**, **SeanRBurton** and **Johnny****Lawrence**, we are seeing the return of Summer League favorites here as well, include Peoples Choice award winner **Butterfly ü¶ã Tamer **sporting the brand new [Smart Caterpillar](__GHOST_URL__/new-community-snake-customizations/) head.

## Battlesnakes to Watch

While the Top 10 spots are some of the most coveted on the leaderboard during league competition, it is often a good idea to take a look on the peripheries in order to identify up-and-coming Battlesnakes who may soon oust the Top Tier Bhumbas from their prized positions.

On these outskirts we can already see some top tier competitors to watch as we move into week 2 of the Fall League, with returning 2021 Summer League Elite division developers **penelopezone**, **exzizt**, **baap**, **Elynx**, **coreyja **and **Len Payne** only a few points away from claiming one of the Top 10 spots.

## New Competitors

Just as looking around the peripheries of the Top 10 can sometimes identify up-and-coming competitors, so too can looking on the very edge of the competition to find brand new developers who are already quickly climbing the ladder.

While many of these competitors, like **git_good** and **jincrypt,** are brand new to league competition and have yet to prove themselves in battle, veteran developers **gregleaver** and **phyrexian **will likely not spend long in their current spots, having both competed in the Elite division throughout the 2021 season.
