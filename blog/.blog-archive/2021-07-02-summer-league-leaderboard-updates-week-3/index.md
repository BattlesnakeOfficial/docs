### Current Top Tier Bhumbas

While **Pruzze v2** has been a force to be reckoned with since the early days of the competition, so too has **BlackHole, **who while firmly seated in 3rd place as of last week, has now graduated to the Elite Tier and tied **Pruzze v2** for the top spot on the ladder.Close behind, ** Salazar Slitherin** remains in 2nd place moving into Week 4 of the competition, with a mere 400 points separating him from both the Elite Tier and the recognition as top Battlesnake of the league.

### Up-and-Coming Competitors

Green may have been the color of the week for strong snakes coming into week three, but as we end off a tough few days of battle, the colors have certainly changed. Climbing four spots from 8th to 4th place **ü§ì Smart Caterpillar üêõ** has certainly become a Battlesnake to watch closely, as have three new snakes‚Äî**Go snake, spaceworm **and **marrrvin**‚Äîwho have recently joined the Top 10, knocking **Green Snake** down three spots to 9th overall in the competition

### New Battlesnakes to Watch

A quick glance at new Battlesnakes on the leaderboard reveals few recognizable faces, but one new competitor who is sure to strike fear into the hearts of those seeking to climb to the top of the ladder is **Pretzel**. Capturing 2nd place in both the Competitive Elite and Royale Platinum Tournaments during Spring League, and remaining at the top of both leaderboards throughout that time, **Pruzze V2** and **Snaky McSnakeface** may be given a run for their money this week as **Pretzel **returns for revenge and some epic competition in pursuit of the title of 2021 Summer League Champion.
