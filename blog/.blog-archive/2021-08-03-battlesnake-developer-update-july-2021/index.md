title: Battlesnake Developer Update - July 2021
authors:

For development work in July, the theme was 'iterate and improve', and we invested our time responding to direct feedback and making improvements to features we thought could use a little fresh paint and love. 

## Rules/CLI Updates

Strongly driven by our [Community Feedback](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions), there were a lot of small improvements made to the [Battlesnake CLI](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules), including preventing `/move` requests from being sent to eliminated Battlesnakes, sending `/end` data to every Battlesnake and not just the winner, fixing missing information in `game.rulset`, and removing inconsistencies in how rules were applied in Royale mode.

Thanks to our wonderful community for reporting these issues, and special thanks to those who made Pull Requests to help address some of them! Shoutout to [Nettogrof](https://github.com/Nettogrof), [exzizt](https://github.com/exzizt), [jiricodes](https://github.com/jiricodes), and [joram](https://github.com/joram) who all contributed to this repo in July.

## Highlighting Community Twitch Streams

While the events of 2020/21 unexpectedly nudged the Battlesnake team into cross-training as Twitch streamers, the real delight is now watching all the incredible folks streaming their own Battlesnake journeys - and we don't want to miss a single moment of it.

With the help of [Andrew](__GHOST_URL__/author/andrew/), we now have the *#livestreams* channel in [Discord](play.battlesnake.com/discord) and updated the [Battlesnake Live](https://play.battlesnake.com/live/) page to include all streams that contain the term 'Battlesnake'. We want to show our appreciation and make it easy to find this great Community Â content.

## UI Improvements when Watching Games

It was time for an iteration on the screen for watching a game, and while the functionality remains the the same, we think making those features more discoverable by moving and highlighting the 'Rematch' button, and bringing more focus to the game graphs, will help both new and established Battlesnake developers.

## Starter Battlesnakes

Another big focus area in July was updating our Starter Projects - and since we already wrote a [blog post](__GHOST_URL__/battlesnake-starter-project-updates/) about it, check that out for details, and maybe use this as an excuse to spin up a fresh Battlesnake in a new programming language!

## Summer League 2021

As we run each league, we continue to monitor, tweak, and experiment, and Summer League has been no exception. This includes continuing to learn about and develop the tournament structure, which we have [written about]() and discussed with the community in Discord this July.

This league, we also had a fantastic time with the [Caster Crown](https://play.battlesnake.com/league/summer-league-2021/#caster-crown), which came to its stunning conclusion on July 24th.

Congratulations to everyone who qualified for the tournament, and thank you all for playing Battlesnake! We'll be reviewing everything we learned this round, and bringing those lessons into Fall League - stay tuned for more details on that!
