With the record-setting Spring League now firmly entrenched in the history of Battlesnake, we are thrilled to announce the launch of our next phase of the 2021 competitive season - the [Summer League](https://play.battlesnake.com/summer-league)!

Officially opened during the Welcome Show which streamed on June 11th, here are some of the highlights you need to know to prepare for [Summer League](https://play.battlesnake.com/summer-league) play.

## New League Format

While progressive tiers, first introduced in the 2021 Spring League, are here to stay, the dual ladders have been dropped this summer, with the Competitive 1v1 ladder benched in favor of Royale Mode for the [Summer League](https://play.battlesnake.com/summer-league)!

Featuring 4 players on an 11x11 board, we have also made tier progression a bit tougher for this phase of the season, with the move from silver to gold an added challenge for Battlesnake Developers who want to make it to the live tournament, which will be streaming on Twitch on **Saturday, July 31st at 10am PT.**

## Awesome New Tier Rewards

Just as with Spring League, progression through each tier doesn't just come with bragging rights and the potential to be featured in the live tournament, Battlesnake Developers will also be able to earn some awesome new heads and tails.

For our Top Tier Bhumba's, rewards will be going far beyond the digital, as we try to one-up the custom Battlesnake Coffee Mugs from Spring League, and ship some epic custom Merch to Elite Battlesnake Developers at the end of the season. 

## New Twitch Stream Schedule

This spring we introduced some great new streams with **Coding Badly **and **Deep Learning **which were met with great support from the Battlesnake Community.Hot on the heels of that success, this summer we are excited to launch two new series with **Community Corner** and **Live Platform Coding **added to your regularly scheduled Battlesnake programming, with streams happening every **Thursday at 1pm PT  / 4pm ET / 8PM GMT** on [twitch.tv/battlesnakeofficial](https://twitch.tv/battlesnakeofficial).

If you noticed that **Snake Pit Live!** was missing from that Thursday schedule, you are absolutely correct, as it has been moved to its own weekly timeslot on **Saturday's at 10am PT  / 1pm ET,** which is when you'll be able to hang out with your favorite casters as they provide Arena and League Updates, run Showdowns and of course run some awesome Prize and Merch Giveaways!

### Introduction of Caster Houses

Building on the "Caster Fantasy Draft" which was introduced this spring, this summer's **Snake Pit Live!** streams will feature [Caster Houses](https://play.battlesnake.com/league/summer-league-2021/#info-caster-crown), a fun new way for you customize your Battlesnake while also connecting with our amazing Casters: Aileen, Joe, Chris and Curtis.

To join a house, simply add you Casters favorite head and custom color to your Battlesnake and watch **Snake Pit Live!** to see how your House fares in the battle.
