November has seen the completion of some larger projects the dev team has been working on, and we are all really pleased to finally be able to share them with you.

## That's a wrap on Fall League 2021!

A huge congratulations out to all the participants of the 2021 Fall League, I hope you had just as much fun as we did. There were so many great Battlesnake games to showcase, we had to split the tournament games over two days to get them all in there! You can still catch the videos from the event at [battlesnake.tv](battlesnake.tv)

The Winter Classic invitational will be wrapping up our 2021 season. Invites are being sent out now to the many fine champions we've seen this past year, allowing them to enter their Battlesnake into this exclusive tournament. We will also be unveiling a special food icon created for this event, as designed by our [Fall League Caster Crown winner](https://play.battlesnake.com/league/fall-league-2021/#caster-crown), Aileen. 

For those of us not on the invite list this year, I hope you'll join me in curling up all cozy on [Dec 11th and Dec 18th](https://play.battlesnake.com/schedule/) to see the finest Battlesnake competitors of the 2021 season duke it out. We'd love to celebrate the end of the season with you, so come hang out in Twitch Chat and cheer with us! 

## Engine Regions

Rob has been incredibly hard at work building Engine Regions for the Battlesnake community, and this November that hard work finally paid off. Engine Regions help level the playing field, by removing the latency penalty that geographically distant servers introduce. We've seen the struggle that our non-North American Battlesnakers have experienced when interacting with the main Battlesnake server located in AWS's Oregon region, and that was a pain point we very much wanted to relieve.

An [earlier announcement](__GHOST_URL__/announcing-engine-regions/) outlines the details of this feature, and we'd be delighted if you would try it out and let us know what you think.

## Putting a pin in Teams

A lot has changed over the years, and one of our older features, Teams, isn't quite achieving what we want it to achieve on the Battlesnake platform. Any existing Battlesnake Teams are still active and functional, but for now we've disabled the ability to create any new Team.

We are going to be revisiting and re-imagining this concept in the future, so don't worry! But for the short term, this functionality has been disabled.

## Beta-Testing for Running your own Competition

I think the most common request we receive is from folks wanting to run their own Battlesnake competition. We know that many determined people have managed to work something out by manually running games, which sounds like a huge amount of work and shows an incredible amount of dedication. While this warms my heart, we think we can do better for you.

For quite a while now, we've been cooking up a way for folks to run their own Battlesnake tournaments, and at last we are ready to launch a beta and start getting community feedback. Huge thanks to [md-hexdrive](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/md-hexdrive/) and [chaelcodes](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/chaelcodes/) for volunteering to take this new feature for a spin.
