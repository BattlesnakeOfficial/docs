Introducing the new **Mystic Moon** tail and **All-Seeing Eye** head! As part of Summer League 2021 we ran the Casters Crown Championship where each member of our famed Battlesnake Casting Crew leading a Caster House in a live competition during episodes of Snake Pit Live! The winner of the crown was the House of Aileen and their prize was the creation of a new head and tail combination to honor the house.

Developer, [Butterfy 🦋 Tamer](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/theapx/), won the *People's Choice Award* during Summer League 2021 for their snake [🤓 Smart Caterpillar 🐛](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/theapx/smart-caterpillar/). The prize for the award was the ability to work with the Battlesnake design team to create a new head to release to the community and thus the new **Smart Caterpillar** head was born!

These new customizations are available right now for everyone.  You can find them on the [Battlesnake Heads and Tails](https://play.battlesnake.com/references/customizations/) reference page in the *Community* section.
