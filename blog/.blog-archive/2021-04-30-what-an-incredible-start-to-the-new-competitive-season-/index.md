It is hard to believe that it has already been two weeks since the end of the 2021 Spring League, and while the team is already busy preparing for our exciting plans this summer, we thought it would be great to recap and highlight some of the top battles from the Royale and Competitive 1v1 Tournaments, and to celebrate our 2021 Spring League Champions.

## Royale Tournament

Streamed live on April 10th, the Royale Tournament was the first of the new season, and it did not disappoint, with plenty of dips, dives, hazard sauce and of course some edge-of-your-seat Battlesnake competition.

### Royale Gold

Things kicked-off with the Royale Gold division, where 32 Battlesnake’s entered into fierce competition for the crown. With nearly an hour of action, which even included a brief appearance by the infamous *Badly Coded Snake,*[*hungry hungry carlos*](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/bobfrit/)ultimately claimed the first championship title of the 2021 season, defeating veteran Battlesnake competitors *Polar Unicorn* and *Untimely Neglected Wearable* in Game 5 of the Royale Gold finals.

### Royale Platinum

With the stage set by some stellar Royale Gold battles, the Royale Premium tournament did not disappoint, with 11 top tier Battlesnake’s facing down each other, and some rather hazardous sauce, in epic competition. Seen as a shoe-in for the Royale Platinum crown, leaderboard dominator and relative newcomer *Pretzel 🥨* put up an incredible fight throughout the competition; but was ultimately defeated in Game 5 against veteran Battlesnake [*Prüzze v2*](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/pruzze/).

### Competitive 1v1 Platinum

As with all the battles throughout the Company Showdown and Gold division, the Platinum level of the 1v1 Tournament continued to showcase some top tier bhumba’s, with many returning favorites to be found amongst the division bracket. Despite some incredible veteran Battlesnake’s in the mix; however, it was a relative newcomer — [*nibsnake by spectral*](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/spectralglitch/) — who defeated the well known *Exploradora by unapersona* in Game 3 of the Competitive 1v1 Platinum finals, claiming the division crown and title.

### Competitive 1v1 Elite

The last tournament bracket of the 2021 Spring League, the Competitive 1v1 Elite division saw the return of Royale Platinum finalists alongside veteran competitors and fan favorites from tournaments gone by. While we missed out on a much anticipated rematch between *Pretzel *🥨and *Prüzze v2*, we did get the chance to see *Pretzel *🥨 take on another Battlesnake heavyweight from the 2020 Winter Classic —[*Snaky McSnakeface by kudu*](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/kudu/) — who after four spectacular battles claimed the elusive Competitive 1v1 Elite division title.
