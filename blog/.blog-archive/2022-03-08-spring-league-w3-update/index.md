With three weeks of competition down the leaderboard continues to be dominated by a trio of top tier bhumbas, and the battle is on for the hearts of the Battlesnake Community in the [2022 Spring League competition](https://play.battlesnake.com/arena/spring-league-2022/).

## Who are the Top Tier Bhumba's of the Week?

A quick glance at the leaderboard this week shows little has changed in the top 3 positions, with [Jaguar Meets Snake](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/waryferryman/jaguar-meets-snake/), [Combat Reptile](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/ambadoom/combat-reptile/) and [Shapeshifter ](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/jonathanarns/shapeshifter-stop-putins-war/)continuing to fight for Spring League supremacy, putting even more distance between themselves and the remaining Elite Tier Battlesnakes.

Despite that distance, however, there is little doubt that the leaderboard is full of some highly competitive Battlesnakes. And so, we thought this week would be a good opportunity to take a look at a few of the talented (yet less well-known) developers and their newly minted Spring League snakes.

Will [BwukMaxi](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/bwuk/bwukmaxi/) be able to regain their lead, or will they and [Hovering Hobbs](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/coreyja/hovering-hobbs/) be forced to concede to this newcomer in the Fan Favorite race?

‚ù§Ô∏è

Only YOU to help decide! [Cheer](https://play.battlesnake.com/arena/spring-league-2022/) for your favorite Battlesnake today!

### What are some of the best Battlesnake names?

While we may never know what sets the current fan favorites apart, there is little doubt about what brings fame, fortune and popularity to many Battlesnakes during the competitive season: **an amazing name!**

Below are a few of our favorite names so far this season, and we can't wait to see what fun and fabulously punny names are store for the rest of 2022.
