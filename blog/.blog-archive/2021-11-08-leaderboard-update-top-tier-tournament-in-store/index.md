With 6 weeks of competition behind us and only 2 weeks to go, we are getting a much better idea of what to expect in the Fall League finale—and it looks like it will be a Battlesnake tournament for the record books!

## Top Tier Bhumbas of the Week

Throughout these leaderboard updates we've focused heavily on the *Top 10* overall competitors, but with potential Elite, Platinum and Gold brackets becoming much more evident, we thought this week would be a great chance to check out some of the top competitors in each of those tiers instead.

### Top *Elite Tier* Bhumbas

The top of the leaderboard has remained much the same this week, with **Prüzze v2** and **Salazar Slitherin** fighting for the top spot, and the ghostly **WhitishMeteor** holding steady in 3rd place for the 6th week in a row. 

With **Nessegrev-gamma** and **haspid** claiming the 4th and 5th spots, the biggest surprise this week is the absence of **Cobra Kai Never Die, **who after sitting in 4th for weeks has dropped to the 7th on the leaderboard.

***What does this mean for the Elite Tournament?*** Considering how strong all of these Battlesnakes have been to date, it's likely that we will see one of them claim the ultimate title of 2021 Fall League Elite Champion.

### Top *Platinum Tier *Bhumbas

With only a few hundred points separating most of the Battlesnakes in this tier, we're excited to see well known developers (like **coreyja** & **The Blue Book**) as well as some new competitors (like **ambadoom**, **cod3m0nk** & **jacno)** represented amongst the *Top Platinum Tier Bhumbas*, with the latter all having joined Battlesnake during the 2021 Fall League competition.

***What does this mean for the Platinum Tournament? ***With so many newcomers, this is a bit of a wildcard tournament, but considering how quickly many of them have climbed the ladder, we are likely so see some strong competition during each of the tournament days later this month.

### Top *Gold Tier* Bhumbas

While the *Platinum Tier* featured many Battlesnake newcomers, in* the Gold Tier *we again see many familiar faces with **unapersona**, **md-hexdrive**, **Dr. Polar Humenn**, **altersaddle** & **xavierraffin** all veteran competitors with records stretching back as far as the 2020 Stay Home and Code event.

***What does this mean for Gold Tournament?***  Well, if our experience in watching many of these competitors in the past is any indication, it means this may be one of the strongest Gold Tier Tournaments we have ever seen.

### Fan Favorite(s) of the Week

While there may be more than 10,000 points separating **Pruzze v2** and **Demifemme (She or They pronouns)** on the Fall League leaderboard, in the hearts of Battlesnake fans there is no difference at all, as both of these fierce competitors break the 6 way fan favorite tie from the last update and claim the *15 cheers *needed to become the Fan Favorites of the week!

## Casters Crown Championship

If you've caught any of the recent ***Snake Pit Live!***streams, you'd know that all season long we've been running the ***Caster's Crown Championship***, a head-to-head competition between the Houses of Aileen, Curtis, Joe and Chris to determine who is the ultimate 2021 Fall League Caster.  

While the Crown has yet to be placed upon anyone's head, the points have been tallied from the latest ***Snake Pit Live!***episode and it seems the *House of Aileen* may be set to claim the crown for the second league in a row.
