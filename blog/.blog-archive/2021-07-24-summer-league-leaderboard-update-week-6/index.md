With more than 500,000 games played and closing in on 1,000,000 points earned, the quest for the title of 2021 Summer League Champion has never been tougher as we quickly approach what is sure to be an incredible tournament on July 31st!

### Current Top Tier Bhumbas

If you have been following these leaderboard updates over the past few weeks, you will likely have noticed that not much has changed this week for the *Top 3*, as **Pretzel**, **Pruzze v2 **and **Green Snake** continue to dominate the competition.

**BlackHole** and **Salazar Slitherin**‚Äîon the other hand‚Äîhave continued their struggle to remain atop the Summer League leaderboard, with BlackHole knocked down most recently by veteran competitor Nettogrof and their new Battlesnake **nessegrev-gamma**, and Salazar Slitherin falling out of *Top 5* altogether.

### Top Competitors to Watch

Further down the leaderboard, though, things are definitely looking much different this week, with **Voxel** and **SneakySnake **making their *Top 10* debut, and (at the time of writing) competitors **Go snake, spaceworm, Algea **and **PepperLongStocking **making way for the triumphant return of ¬†ü§ì **Smart Caterpillar** üêõ and **Green Heart** üíö after their short top tier absence last week.

**Leaderboard Peoples Choice**

While Algea may have dropped out of the *Top 10* this week, they certainly have not dropped out the hearts of the Battlesnake Community ‚ù§Ô∏è who with 14 Cheers have made them the *Top Cheered Battlesnake *of the 2021 Summer League ü•∞

### Summer Streamer Status

Last week we decided to check-in to see how some of the amazing Battlesnake Community streamers were fairing this summer, and after another week of competition there has definitely been a *stream (*üòÇ)of upwards momentum! ¬†

At the top of the streamer leaderboard are **BattlePolar** and **does this work lol, **each moving up slightly this week as they attempt to break into the *Top 20* of the summer, using a cacophony of technologies and at least a little bit of aggression.

A bit further down the leaderboard **kunals-best-snake **had the best week of all, climbing 7 spots to the Platinum Tier with over 8000 points, closely followed by **Nodeaconda-RED,****battlep4nth3r **and **Sneki Snek **all still on a mission to break into the *Top 50*.
