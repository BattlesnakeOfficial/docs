As the number of competitors continues to grow, and the battles get even more exciting to watch, it's hard to believe there is only a month of competition left until the exciting conclusion to 2021 Fall League and what is sure to be an incredible Royale Tournament.

### Top Tier Bhumbas of the Week

Although their lead has continued to increase over the past week, not much else has changed at the very top of the Fall League Leaderboard, with **Prüzze v2, Salazar Slitherin** and **WhitishMeteor **holding onto their Top 3 positions moving into the final month of competition.

Further down the leaderboard; however, there has certainly been an exciting update for those who've been following the competition, with **Cobra Kai Never Die**, **haspid**, **Nessegrev-gamma**, **Pea Eater** and **😎 **Nerdy Caterpillar**** 🐛 qualifying for the Platinum Tournament and 💀💀💀💀💀 falling from 10th to 13th place this week, replaced by Week 3 *Competitor to Watch***Fer-De-Lance**.

### Competitors to Watch

Much as with the* Top Tier Bhumbas of the Week*, if you have been reading these leaderboard updates over the past month, you will notice many of the same competitors skirting around the edges of the Top 10 this week, including **Demifemme**,  **Black Heart** 🖤, **Secret Snake,** and 💀💀💀💀💀.

That said, while there are many familiar faces, we are also very excited to see two new competitors enter into the fray—as of this update—with *DataWraith *and *pacevedom *bringing their *Rust *and *C++* powered Battlesnakes **Rinzler **and **pacevedo **(respectively) rocketing up the leaderboard to land amongst some of the top Battlesnake developers we have seen in the 2021 competitive season so far.

### Current Fall League Fan Favorite

Although they may close out our list of *Competitors to Watch *moving into the second month of competition, **sharptooth **is certainly nowhere near the bottom of another important Fall League list, claiming 13 cheers and overtaking **Rocket Scarf** to claim the title of *Battlesnake Fan Favorite* for this week.

### Celebrating Creative Customizations

While Battlesnake is by its very nature competitive, so much of what makes that competition so much fun to watch is the community and creativity behind each snake.

While very often that creativity comes in the form of "punny" names, thanks to a growing repository of Battlesnake Heads & Tails, developers are now able to [personalize their snakes](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/personalization) even more through creative customization combinations.

While at the top of the leaderboard we can certainly see some great combinations, as we look further down the leaderboard we can see that what some competitors lack in points, they make up for in style with some sensational seasonal skins.

Check out a few of our favorite Battlesnake Head and Tail combinations below.
