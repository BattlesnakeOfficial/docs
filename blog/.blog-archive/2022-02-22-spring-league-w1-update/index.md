With 10 competitors already battling-it-out in the [Spring League](https://play.battlesnake.com/spring-league) Elite Tier, it's clear that developers were busy during the off-season preparing for an exciting start to the [2022 Competitive Season](/)!

### What is the Spring League all about?

For those who haven't been following Battlesnake over the past year, Spring League is part of what is now known as "Competitive Battlesnake", a series of [competitive leagues](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/quick-start-league-guide) that run throughout the year.

Battlesnake developers of any skill level can join these leagues, earn rank and rewards through daily automated gameplay, and keep track of progress and replays with real-time leaderboards. 

At the end of each league, qualifying Battlesnakes participate in a [live-streamed Battlesnake Tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY0tzh2eUNo) for additional prizes!

### What is the Spring League format?

With matches runing daily at **10 pm PT / 1 am ET ,** the [2022 Spring League](https://play.battlesnake.com/spring-league) features our new "[Wrapped](/)" hazard map.

This new format makes for some fun games to watch, as the four snakes on the board now wrap across the wall boundries to avoiding an ever expanding spiral of hazard sauce that spawns each game. 

### Who are the Top Tier Bhumba's of the Week?

If you have been following competitive Battlesnake over the past year, you will certainly recognize at least a few of the "Top Tier Bhumba's" this week, including 2021 Fall League Elite Champion [Salazar Slitherin](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/kudu/#achievements) and 2021 Winter Classic Elite Champion [Combat Reptile](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/ambadoom/#achievements).

While these are certainly two Battlesnakes to watch as we move into the new week, with the remaining top five leaderboard positions filled out with some equally impressive Battlesnakes, we may soon be adding [Pea Eater](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/alxv/#achievements), [Shapeshifter](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/jonathanarns/#achievements) or [Jaguar Meets Snake](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/waryferryman/#achievements) to a growing list of champions.

### Who is the current Spring League Fan Favorite?

First introduced during the 2021 Summer League, "Fan Favorites" are the snakes who receive the most C*heers *during the 8 weeks of competition.

Cheers are not the only accolades these Battlesnakes take home, however. They also have the chance to design their own custom Battlesnake head, such as the [Smart Caterpillar ](__GHOST_URL__/new-community-snake-customizations/)and [Trans Rights](__GHOST_URL__/trans-rights-customization/) heads from the last season.

With the previous fan favorite [Demifemme](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/penelopezone/demifemme-she-or-they-pronouns/) topping out at 15 cheers, this weeks favorites [BwukMaxi](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/bwuk/bwukmaxi/) and [Hovering Hobbs](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/coreyja/hovering-hobbs/) are off to a great start, already sitting at 15 cheers as we enter week two of the competition!
