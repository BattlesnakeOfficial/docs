title: Battlesnake Developer Update - August 2021

I'd like to start by extending a warm welcome to our newest Battlesnake Developers, [Rob](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/robbles/) and [Sherri](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/codewench), who both joined the Battlesnake team this August! Rob is an old-school Battlesnake player, and the original author of the [Chicken Snake](https://www.dyspatch.io/blog/snaking2_electric_boogaloo/), a Hall-of-Fame Battlesnake from the annals of time. Sherri, while relatively new to the Battlesnake scene, has an impressive track record in both the game dev and web dev world. Both of them are powerhouse additions to the team, and we're really glad to have them.

While there are always plenty of things that need doing when ramping up new developers on the team, we did manage to get some platform updates out this month.

## Create Game now shows Recent Battlesnakes

When playing an ad-hoc Battlesnake game, folks have noted that they'd like to be able to easily [create games with the same Battlesnakes](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions/59) rather than having to search for them each time.
Now when you click the 'Play Game' button, if you have any games in your local history, Battlesnakes from those games will appear in a new section, '*Recently Played Battlesnakes*' for you to pick from.

## Engine Rule Updates

We heard [your feedback](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions/63) from Summer League about how rules get evaluated when playing a Royale game, and we agree, a change was needed. It was also important to us to get that done before we kicked off [Fall League](https://play.battlesnake.com/league/fall-league-2021/?utm_source=battlesnake_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dev_update_august_2021&amp;utm_content=fall_league_2021), which will feature Competitive Royale games, and will use the updated hazard sauce evaluation.

The eagle-eyed amongst you may have also noticed some [other changes](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api#rulesetsettings) this past August, so to make sure everyone is on the same page and up to date, there is a more [detailed blog post](__GHOST_URL__/updates-to-royale-mode-and/) outlining everything you need to know around Engine updates to ensure your Battlesnake code is up-to-date.

## Reward Code Updates

If you've been lucky, and hung out in the right [Twitch Stream](https://play.battlesnake.com/live/?utm_source=battlesnake_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dev_update_august_2021&amp;utm_content=live) at the right time, you may have been able to get your hands on a reward code for a locked [Battlesnake customization](https://play.battlesnake.com/references/customizations/?utm_source=battlesnake_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dev_update_august_2021&amp;utm_content=customizations). It was an experimental reward system we tried out for Summer League, and we liked it enough to code in a more permanent solution that could be used for more digital goodies than just custom heads and tails.

OK - so yes, it doesn't look any different, and we haven't released any new reward codes.... *yet*. But as developers, I think we can all appreciate the effort it takes to rearrange the wiring under the hood. I would also recommend you file this information away in the back of your head, so you are ready when the next reward code makes an appearance!

## Fall League 2021

August 30th marked the date that pre-registration opened for [Fall League](https://play.battlesnake.com/league/fall-league-2021/?utm_source=battlesnake_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dev_update_august_2021&amp;utm_content=fall_league_2021). While there is always effort in getting the new League page up and live, I would claim that our time in August was most critically spent in reviewing and providing feedback on the new Fall League design assets - most important of course, being selecting a new food icon for Fall. And before you ask, no, I will not be revealing any *spicy* hints about what it is at this time.

Shoutout to our designer Darcy, who has once again knocked it out of the park and continues to make Battlesnake look as fun as it is to play.
