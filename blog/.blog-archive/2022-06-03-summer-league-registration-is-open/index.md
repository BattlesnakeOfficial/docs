## What's New in Summer League 2022?

### Introducing the Arcade Maze Map

This Summer League, we're using a new map that features winding paths of deadly hazard walls that are not only impassible by Battlesnakes, but a one-hit kill! This map is a bit of a chonker too with a **19x21 game board**.

### Deadly Hazard Walls

One wrong move could spell *game over* for your Battlesnake. Collisions with a hazard wall are fatal‚Äîdealing 100 damage to your Battlesnake. This is a big change from previous game modes where hazard damage was limited to 14 per turn.

### Wrapped Mode

Don't mind that gap. Battlesnakes can pass through the outer boundaries of the board by using gaps in the hazard walls to appear on the opposite side. Should another Battlesnake be on the other side of the board at the same time, [standard collision rules apply. ](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/game/rules#collisions)
