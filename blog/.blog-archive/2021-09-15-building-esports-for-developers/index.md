**Today, the Battlesnake team is excited to announce $1.5M in funding to build gaming and eSports for developers.**

In 2019 we began working on Battlesnake full-time, launching [play.battlesnake.com](https://play.battlesnake.com), an "always-on" version of Battlesnake that could be played by any developer, anywhere, at any time. In 2020, we launched the Global Battlesnake Arena and our Seasonal Competitive Leagues.

Since then over **10,000 developers** have played 10 million games of Battlesnake, both in person and online. Beyond that, more than **50,000 friends, kids, parents, and colleagues** have [watched public competitions, cheering, witnessing heartbreak, and celebrating success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY0tzh2eUNo). 

It's humbling and inspiring to think that this all began in a small classroom, in a small community, simply as a fun way for experienced programmers to spend a Saturday. We've truly come a long way :)

**Our mission is simple.**

We believe programming should be fun for everyone, and that even the most experienced programmers deserve a platform for self-directed learning and exploration that is entertaining, playful, and naturally collaborative.

To help us build and grow, we've raised $1.5M led by Madrona Venture Group ‚Äî a firm that has supported tech in the Pacific Northwest for over 20 years. The team at Madrona is a wonderful partner, and we're thrilled to be working with them. This funding round also includes Liquid 2, Ascend, members of 200 OK, and many veteran angel investors in the developer and gaming space.

**The Battlesnake community is one of the best.**

Battlesnake has a unique ability to bring together developers of all backgrounds and experiences, and to foster collaboration and technical exploration unlike anything else. Our Discord is packed with people helping each other, and our live streams have more laughs than most. Battlesnake developers are staggeringly dedicated to pushing the boundaries of the game and giving back to the community.

Now, we have an opportunity to bring Battlesnake to hundreds of thousands of developers worldwide.

In the last few years, the world has changed dramatically, with coding resources and education becoming free and accessible to nearly everyone. The number of tools, platforms, and services for developers is also increasing at an incredible pace, and there's been an immense rise in developer content creators on platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and even Instagram. 

We believe this is just beginning, and that the way experienced developers interact with programming is changing forever.

**What's next for Battlesnake?**

Our team has grown, and we're already working on some really fun changes and developer experience updates, including better support for local Battlesnake development and multi-cloud support for developers outside North America. Stay tuned here, and follow along on [GitHub](https://play.battlesnake.com/feedback) to see what's coming next.
