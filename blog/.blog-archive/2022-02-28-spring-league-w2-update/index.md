With another week of [Spring League](https://play.battlesnake.com/spring-league) now complete, we are getting a much clearer picture of which are the competitors to watch as the first tournament of the season fast approaches on March 19th.

## Who are the Top Tier Bhumba's of the Week?

Despite a few more Battlesnake's entering the Elite Tier of competition this week, not much has changed at the very top of the [Spring League](https://play.battlesnake.com/spring-league) leaderboard, with **Jaguar Meets Snake**, **Combat Reptile** and **Shapeshifter** holding-on to the top 3 spots.

With that in mind, we thought this would be a great chance to take a closer look at what makes these *Top Tier Bhumba's* the best-of-the-best so far in the season.

### Who is the current Spring League Fan Favorite?

With just one new cheer, **BwukMaxi** didn't add too many fans to its list of supporters this week, but it was enough to edge out **Hovering Hobbs **and take the lead as the Spring League Fan Favorite.

While **BwukMaxi's** secret to fame remains a mystery, we thought we should give it the same Top Tier Treatment as the other featured Battlesnakes this week by taking a look at what makes it tick!

### Who is getting creative with their Customizations?

While head-to-head battles are a big part of the Battlesnake competitive season, so too is checking out which heads (and tails) are featured in those battles. 

And so, with more [head and tail customizations](https://play.battlesnake.com/references/customizations/) available than ever before, we thought this update was a great chance to take a look through the leaderboard and see what kind of combinations have been showcased so far in the 2022 Spring League.

While we found a ton of [creative customizations](https://play.battlesnake.com/references/customizations/), some of our favorites included:

- **Becca Lyria** - Head: *crystal-power | *Tail: *crystal-power*
- **Be Still, My Heart** - Head: *mustache* | Tail: *skinny-jeans*
- **Boundless Scuttlecoil** - Head: *lantern-fish* | Tail: *virus*
- **Mollywobbles** - Head: *trans-rights-scarf* | Tail: *flake*
