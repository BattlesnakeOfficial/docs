A lot of work in May was centered around improving the Battlesnake experience for new users and the new challenge system. 

## Challenges!

We have completed a total overhaul of the Challenges system to make it a more intuitive and flexible feature of the Battlesnake Platform. The leaderboards have been removed and instead each challenge is now a completable puzzle to solve. Once you succeed at a challenge you are done! This gives us more flexibility to create more engaging puzzles.  

Completing challenges will earn achievements, and completing groups of challenges can unlock new customizations!

## New User Improvements

We deployed the first phase of a new onboarding system for users that are just starting with Battlesnake. The *Battlesnake Training Program* is list of milestones  for Battlesnake developers on how the platform works and what they need to do to create a great Battlesnake that can complete competitively in leagues and on the global arenas.

Over the coming months we are planning a major user interface overhaul and will be implemented a few more phases of the onboarding system, making it easy and more fun to participate in Battlesnake!

## Community Feedback

We have centralized how we want to get official feedback around the Battlesnake platform from the community in an effort to give better transparency on what we are doing to improve the system. A GitHub discussion is now live: [https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/feedback/discussions)!

The discussion board is where will be will be collecting, reviewing and prioritizing all of the input from the community around feature requests, game ideas, platform enhancements and bugs.  The team will be reviewing submissions weekly and we encourage members of the community to scan through the discussions to add their own comments, examples and ideas.
