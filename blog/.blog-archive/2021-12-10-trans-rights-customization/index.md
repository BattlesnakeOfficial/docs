We are incredibly excited to announce the launch of our newest community customization, the "Trans Rights Scarf" Battlesnake head, created in collaboration with Fall League People's Choice Award Winner [penelopezone](https://play.battlesnake.com/u/penelopezone/).

> "It's been important to me to express my gender identity in all walks of my life since I came out. Being an active participant in Battlesnake, and winning the popular vote this Fall League, I felt like having a way to do it in the game felt really right. I'm so glad to see Battlesnake say trans rights"

This awesome new customization is available right now for everyone! You can find out more about how to use it ,and our other community-created designs, by visiting the [Heads and Tails Guide](https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/customizations) in the Battlesnake Docs.
