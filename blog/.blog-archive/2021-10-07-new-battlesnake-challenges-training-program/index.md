This week we released some updates to [Battlesnake Challenges](https://play.battlesnake.com/challenges/), including a new set of Training Program Challenges! Most Battlesnake Developers use these challenges to get started, making them a core piece of the Battlesnake experience.

The new challenges should provide a guided and intuitive approach to playing the game, progressively introducing the idea of avoidance and safe play. Developers completing these challenges should feel ready to start competitive play ðŸ¥³

We've also added the ability to **reset challenge progress** whenever you'd like, allowing anyone to reuse the training program to test new ideas.

If you haven't tried the challenges yet, definitely check them out, and if you're a challenge veteran, we hope you enjoy the improvements we've made with this update :)

As always, we love hearing feedback from the community. [Let us know what you think over on the feedback forum.](https://play.battlesnake.com/feedback) ðŸ˜Š
