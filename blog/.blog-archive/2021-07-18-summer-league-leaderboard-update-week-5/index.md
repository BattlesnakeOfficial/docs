### Current Top Tier Bhumbas

After a short hiatus following some devastating Spring League defeats, the leaderboard juggernaut **Pretzel **has returned with a vengeance this summer, knocking** Pruzze v2** out of the 1st place position after 4 weeks atop the board. 

**Green Snake **too has been a competitor to watch, moving up four positions from last week to take 3rd place on the leaderboard, knocking veteran Battlesnake competitor **Blackhole **down to 4th position, albeit only by only a slim margin. 

In more surprising news this week, **Salazar Slitherin** has dropped out of the top spots on the board, with more than 2000 points now separating it from the 2nd place it held last week, and less than 50 from falling out of the *Top 5* entirely.

### Up-and-Coming Competitors

With only 20 points now separating it from the coveted *Top Tier Bhumba* status, **nessegrev-gamma **continues to show its readiness to break into the *Top 5*, while competition regular **algea **seems content in 10th place for a second week in a row. 

**Go snake **& **PepperLongStocking **üß¶on the other hand seem ready to make their mark on the Summer League competition, as they become the two newest members of this Elite summer cadre of Battlesnakes, replacing ü§ì ****Smart Caterpillar ****üêõ********& **Green Heart **üíö who now only straddle the *Top 10*.

### Sensational Summer Streamers

If you're a regular Twitch or YouTube viewer, you may have noticed a recent uptick in the Battlesnake-related content on each of these platforms, with some amazing developers live-coding their journey up the Summer League Leaderboard. 

With this in mind, we thought this weeks update was a great opportunity to check in on where those streamer's are sitting, and to highlight some of the awesome content they have been creating over the past few weeks of competition!

Atop the streamer leaderboard is **[Dr. Polar Humenn](https://www.twitch.tv/drpolarhumenn/)**, who after just over 2 weeks has already broken into the Platinum Tier, alongside **[penelope_zone](https://www.twitch.tv/penelope_zone/)**who currently sits in 38th position with their Rust language Battlesnake.
