### Did you know the Battlesnake Game Engine is built in Go?

Well if you didn't, that's exactly the reason we were recently invited to be featured guests on [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime/182), a Golang-centered podcast from the team at [changelog.com](changelog.com).

In the episode, Battlesnake's very own [Brad Van Vugt](https://twitter.com/bvanvugt?) sat down [Jon Calhoun](https://twitter.com/joncalhoun) and [Mat Ryer](https://twitter.com/matryer) of [Changelog ](https://changelog.com)to introduce them to the Battlesnake platform, talking about everything from the history of the community and competition, to why non-negotiable job offers are such an important consideration during the hiring process in early stage start-ups.

Check out the entire podcast above, or watch the livestream recording below to catch the crew battling it out in their own [Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime/182) Showdowns.
