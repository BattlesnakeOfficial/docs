Considering there are so many amazing Battlesnakes in competition for the crown already this league, we thought it might be a good idea to keep you, our awesome Community, up-to-date on who is currently at the top of the leaderboard and what up-and-coming Battlesnakes might be a force-to-be-reckoned-with in the coming weeks of 2021 Summer League competition.

### Current Top Tier Bhumbas

While **Pruzze v2** remains in the top spot following a strong showing in the first week of the league, the gap between Top Tier Bhumba's is quickly closing with three Battlesnakes now in the Platinum Tier and** Salazar Slitherin **less than 500 points away from the top spot on the 2021 Summer League leaderboard.

### Up-and-Coming Competitors

Though **Algae **and **Green Heart** are certainly two Battlesnake's to watch moving into the third week of the competition, there seems to be a theme of green across many of the bhumba's quickly climbing the ladder towards the Platinum tier, with newcomer **PepperLongStocking **and veteran **SneakySnake **close behind **Green Snake** and **Hydra Aius Locutius** as they make their way to the top.

### New Battlesnake's to Watch

While green may be the theme at the top, red seems to be the primary color at the bottom, with many new Battlesnake names making their debut on the 2021 Summer League leaderboard. One of those Battlesnakes; however, is anything but new, with 2021 Spring League semi-finalist **HungerOfHadar v1.1** sure to move quickly up the leaderboard going into the third week of the competition.
