If you haven’t already heard, gone are the old Rookie, Veteran and Elite Divisions as we introduce a new tiered ladder system with multiple game modes, custom badges and some awesome limited-edition, in-game rewards.

These great new features, and much more, were on display when we launched the 2021 Spring League a few weeks ago on our Welcome Show with Brad, Aurora and Aileen, which you can check out on the [Battlesnake YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/battlesnake) along with some other great Spring League content.
