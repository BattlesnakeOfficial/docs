Today we‚Äôre annoucning that the Battlesnake team is joining [DevCycle](https://devcycle.com/?utm_source=Referral&utm_medium=battlesnake-blog&utm_campaign=acquisition-communication), a leading feature management company helping talented teams build great software. Combined, we‚Äôll be able to support developers from all experiences and backgrounds in becoming better programmers and delivering amazing products worldwide.

### How we got here

Battlesnake was originally created to connect professional developers with prospective employers. We were tired of employers making hiring decisions based on homework assignments and coding puzzles, and we wanted to create a way for developers to showcase their expertise on their own terms, and on their own schedule.

Since launch, _**Battlesnake has changed dramatically**_. Rather than being recruitment focused, it began filling a huge need for an overlooked audience‚Äîexperienced developers wanting to learn and try something new. Modern programming education tends to be built for novices, not experts, and experienced programmers were coming to Battlesnake specifically to fill this need.

In many ways, Battlesnake has evolved to become the ‚Äúultimate side project‚Äù for experienced developers. And we love that.

As a team, we decided we didn‚Äôt want Battlesnake to be another recruiting or personal data aggregation platform ‚Äì and neither did our players. So instead, we adopted a new mission: to help every developer become a better developer. No recruiters, no data sharing or opt-ins, just awesome programmers building awesome things.

**Joining DevCycle allows us to continue supporting this vision for Battlesnake** as a safe place for experienced developers to learn, share, collaborate, and have fun programming.

### What does this mean for Battlesnake players?

* **The community will continue to be supported.** We‚Äôre excited to share that DevCycle will be supporting Battlesnake as part of the acquisition. Developers will still be able to play and compete just as always.

* **Battlesnake will continue to reflect our core values.** Our mission is to help every developer, become a better developer. We believe in supporting developers worldwide and building meaningful communities around programming. Our [mission, values](https://play.battlesnake.com/mission), and [privacy policy](https://play.battlesnake.com/privacy) will not change with this acquisition.

* **As we transition, there will be some changes.** In the upcoming months, some planned events and feature updates will be paused as we work through the transition. We can‚Äôt promise you it won‚Äôt be a bumpy ride, but we can promise to give Battlesnake the care it deserves.

### Thank you, for helping us get here.
