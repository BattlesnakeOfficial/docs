### Veteran Division

With such a strong showing from the Rookie Division, expectations were high for Veteran competitors, and they certainly did not disappoint, with all 16 snakes entering the arena ready to show what it takes to compete in a Battlesnake tournament at this level.

The top developers in the Veteran Division certainly helped to deliver that message to fans and fellow competitors alike, with the eight snakes competing in the semi-finals showcasing the type of competition and gameplay we have all come to expect from Battlesnake tournaments.

Despite being the smallest of the three divisions, with only eight snakes qualifying for the 2020 Winter Classic, competition was incredibly tough, with each and every game demonstrating the strategy and talent it takes to become an Elite Battlesnake Developer.
