## Fall League 2020 Format

[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com)’s Fall League 2020, runs October 23 to December 5, involving a series of challenges released each two-week period. Challenge arenas require you to write a new snake to compete under different rules, and let you unlock new, limited-edition challenge skins (if you play 100+ games) and even win some awesome prize packs!

## Winner of Fall League Duels Arena

The first challenge of the 2020 Fall League was the **Duels Arena:**

> *Two *[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com)’s *on a small board and nowhere to hide. Time to focus on those end game algorithms to out maneuver your opponent.*

Running from October 23 to November 7, competition in this inaugural arena was intense, with [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com)*Tofu *ultimately winning the first Fall League Champion Prize Pack.

## Winner of Fall League Duels Mini Tournament

While *Tofu *reigned supreme over the Duels arena during the first two weeks of the Fall League, Snake Pit Live! gave competing [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) Developers another chance to fight for the crown in the Duels Mini-Tournament which took place live on the stream.

Despite a valiant effort by other Snakes, *Tofu *managed to hold on to the title, winning another Prize Pack and becoming the reigning Fall League Champion with his impressive Game 2 win in the 2020 [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) Fall League Duels Challenge Championship Finals.

## New Fall League Speed Snake Challenge

While the Duels Challenge was certainly a highlight of this Snake Pit Live! the stream also featured the launch of our newest Fall League challenge running November 7–20th, **Speed Snake:**

> The time for thinking is over! Build a Battlesnake with fast reflexes and good instincts to compete in this Challenge Arena. Six Battlesnakes must not only contend with each other but a blistering 150 millisecond limit on response times for moves.

As usual, participants who compete in 100+ games are able to unlock custom, limited-edition skins, in the case of the Speed Snake Challenge, unlocking the ‘Pumpkin Head’ [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) Head.

While the announcement of the challenge by Caster Joe was definitely highly anticipated by those watching the stream, nowhere was the excitement more evident than through Caster Aileen hinting at what the challenge name would be throughout the stream, specifically her hints showcasing an appreciation of Point Break era Keanu Reeves, the star of the 1995 movie *Speed*.
