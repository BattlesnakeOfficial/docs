Due to growing concerns surrounding COVID-19, and along with guidance from PHAC, WHO, and other health authorities, the Battlesnake team has decided to postpone our [Battlesnake Victoria 2020](https://play.battlesnake.com/events/battlesnake-2020-Victoria/) event until later this year.

<!--truncate-->

This decision was not made lightly and we are disappointed. Ultimately, as event organizers and producers, we have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our attendees and do our part to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

Over the coming weeks we will continue to monitor the situation. Our plan is to reschedule the event once it becomes safe to do so, and we’ll have more information available at that time.

If you purchased a Limited Edition Victoria 2020 T-Shirt, you will receive a full refund through Eventbrite in the next few days.

Battlesnake is first and foremost a global online community, and our team is already working hard on some new [virtual Battlesnake events](https://play.battlesnake.com/events/winter-classic-2019/) in the coming months — stay tuned.

As always, we appreciate the enthusiasm, passion, and understanding of the Battlesnake Developer Community. If you have any questions or concerns, we’d be happy to address them — please contact events@battlesnake.com.

Thanks, 
The Battlesnake Team
